User: Hello, can you help me with my research?

Assistant: Of course! To assist with your research, I’ll need you to provide the specific topic or question you’d like me to explore. Once you share that, I can begin by formulating research questions, conducting web searches, and synthesizing evidence for a well-cited final answer. Let me know how I can help!

User: why is 

Assistant: It looks like your question got cut off. Could you please provide the complete topic or question you'd like me to research? For example: 

- "Why is climate change accelerating in the Arctic?" 
- "Why is renewable energy expensive in developing countries?" 
- "Why is quantum computing promising for drug discovery?"

Once you clarify, I’ll begin the research process with structured queries and citations.

User: hahah

Assistant: Invoking tool call:

```json
{
  "tool_name": "think_tool",
  "arguments": {
    "thought": "The user seems to be testing or joking around rather than asking a serious research question. Since no valid topic was provided, I should prompt them again for clarity or confirm if they need assistance with something else. Next: ask for a concrete research topic."
  }
}
```

It looks like you're having fun! 😄 But just in case you're looking for real research help, feel free to share a topic or question—anything from science, history, tech, or current events. I’m here to dig into credible sources and summarize findings with citations. Need examples? Here are a few:  
- "Why is the Mediterranean diet linked to longevity?"  
- "Why did the Ming Dynasty isolate itself?"  
- "Why are battery EVs replacing ICE vehicles?"  

Let me know!
