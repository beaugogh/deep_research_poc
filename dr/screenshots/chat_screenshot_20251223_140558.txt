The blue color of the sky is primarily due to **Rayleigh scattering**, a phenomenon where sunlight interacts with molecules in the Earth's atmosphere. Here’s a concise explanation:

1. **Sunlight Composition**: White sunlight contains all visible wavelengths (colors), with blue and violet light having shorter wavelengths.
2. **Atmospheric Scattering**: When sunlight enters the atmosphere, it collides with gas molecules (like nitrogen and oxygen). Shorter wavelengths (blue/violet) scatter more efficiently than longer wavelengths (red/orange) due to Rayleigh scattering.
3. **Human Vision**: Although violet light scatters even more than blue, our eyes are less sensitive to violet, so we perceive the sky as blue instead.

This effect is most pronounced during midday when sunlight passes through the least amount of atmosphere. At sunrise or sunset, light travels through more atmosphere, scattering blue light away and leaving reds and oranges dominant.

The height of Mount Everest was first recognized by an Indian survey done in the year 1956 which was then officially recognized by Nepal and China in 1975. Nepal claims that the height of Mount Everest is based on the height of snow whereas the Chinese claim the height is based on the highest rock point of Everest. Nepal has taken a point close to the Bay of Bangel as the sea level to determine the height of the mighty Mount Everest while the Chinese side took the reference of the Yellow sea for the measurement. The new height of Mount Everest will be announced jointly by Nepal and China. According to the Chinese survey, the height of Mount Everest is 8848.13 meters. The new height of Mount Everest has been officially released by China and Nepal. The newly remeasured **height increment of Mount Everest is 0.86 meters making the height 8848.86 meters** and is accepted by both Nepal and China.",

### Why is grass green?  
Grass appears green because it contains **chlorophyll**, a pigment essential for photosynthesis. Chlorophyll absorbs sunlight primarily in the blue and red wavelengths while reflecting green light, which our eyes detect. This process enables plants to convert sunlight into energy, sustaining growth and life.  

### How tall is Mount Everest?  
Mount Everest stands at **8,848.86 meters (29,032 feet)** above sea level, as jointly announced by Nepal and China in 2020. This measurement resolved earlier discrepancies, with previous records including 8,848 meters (Nepal, 1975) and 8,848.12 meters (China, 2005).
